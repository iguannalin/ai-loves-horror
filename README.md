# ai-loves-horror

A horror text-based adventure game made using OpenAI's GPT-3 (Davinci model) API.

The story changes every time it is run, and only Davinci determines what choices players are given to choose from, as well as how the story will end.

## How it works

The app sends a prompt to Davinci to write a text-based adventure game that will give users choices numbered 1-3. When a choice is made, it is added back to the entire story and sent as a prompt to Davinci to send more choices, until the story is finished.
