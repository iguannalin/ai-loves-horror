<p>
    A horror text-based adventure game made using OpenAI's GPT-3 (Davinci model) API.
</p>
<p>
    The story changes every time it is run, and only Davinci determines what choices players are given to choose from, as well as how the story will end.
</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>
    The app sends a prompt to Davinci to write a text-based adventure game that will give users choices numbered 1-3. When a choice is made, it is added back to the entire story and sent as a prompt to Davinci to send more choices, until the story is finished.
