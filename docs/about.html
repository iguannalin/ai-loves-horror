<p>
    A horror text-based adventure game made using OpenAI's GPT-3 (Davinci model) API.
</p>
<p>
    The story changes every time it is run, and only Davinci determines what choices players are given to choose from, as well as how the story will end.
</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>
    The app sends a prompt to Davinci to write a text-based adventure game that will give users choices numbered 1-3. When a choice is made, it is added back to the entire story and sent as a prompt to Davinci to send more choices, until the story is finished.
</p>
<h2>
    Notes
</h2>
<p>
    It's interesting how Davinci is able to create a cohesive story that follows the theme of a horror adventure game. The stories Davinci generates usually consists of one spooky figure in a strange place, and the user is given choices to confront the figure or run away.
</p>
<p>
    Somehow the story always ends in about 5 minutes or so, and Davinci almost always gives a somewhat optimistic ending.
